# LOGISTIC-REGRESSION
In this repository, we harness the scalability and modularity of Jupyter Lab to organize and document various machine learning and deep learning models—each clearly segmented into individual cells for clarity and reproducibility.

Our goal is to predict customer churn in the Indian telecom industry, exploring the real-world challenge of customer retention using modern classification tools.

This project integrates a wide spectrum of binary classification techniques, including:

Traditional machine learning models like Logistic Regression, Random Forests, and Support Vector Machines

Resampling strategies (e.g., SMOTE) to address class imbalance

Hyperparameter optimization and cross-validation workflows

Performance diagnostics through precision-recall tradeoffs and visual analytics

In addition, we implement deep learning architectures—such as multi-layer perceptrons (MLPs), LSTM, and GRU models—to benchmark against classic ML models and analyze performance gains in high-dimensional spaces.

Each stage of experimentation is fully reproducible, visualized, and documented, serving both as a technical guide and a learning resource for those exploring churn modeling in a telecom context.
